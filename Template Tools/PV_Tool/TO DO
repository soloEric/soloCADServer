TO DO:
- pull string sizes in      # done
- pull qty of strings in    # done

- multiple solaredge inverters:
-- need to have individual tags for different inverter modules (ie; 2 different solaredge inverters)
-- need to have individual values for each inverter (ratings)
-- should build out to 3 string inverters, minimum (we have had 3 inverter jobs and they are dumb)

---- maybe we make a function that checks for solaredge, with a quantity of inverters greater 
     than 1, and pulls in a new dataframe, with all that info (Jake likes this idea)
     
     we could simply append our current dataframe (in excel) with inverter_2 and inverter_3 data,
     and if those cells are blank then the python script will just ignore them
     
     yeah, just makes it a hella long boi ya kno?
     
     maybe we just pull in 200 values every time and ignore empty values idk bro
     
 - How to handle derates:
 -- Need load calcs fed into derate function
 -- should derate calcs be handled in Excel or Python?
